## Article 12 - Alternative Dispute Resolution

The purpose of the Declaration is to establish a harmonious community. Because the prompt, efficient, fair and non-belligerent resolution of any disputes is desirable, any controversy arising out of or relating to the condominium instruments or of a breach there of, or any other dispute between (1) the Declarant and (2) the Unit Owners Association or any unit owner shall be resolved as set forth in this Article.

### Section 12.1 **Direct Communication**.

The parties to the disagreement shall set forth their respective positions in the dispute in correspondence. Each party shall respond within seven days after receipt of a letter from the other until agreement is reached.

### Section 12.2 **Mediation**.

If the dispute cannot be resolved through direct communication of the parties, either party may request appointment of a neutral and properly credentialed mediator. Both parties shall participate in the mediation in good faith until the dispute is resolved for a period not to exceed thirty days without the consent of all parties. The cost of the mediation shall be divided equally among the parties.

### Section 12.3 **Arbitration**.

> (a) **Method**. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, either party may request appointment of one or more neutral arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then each party shall appoint one arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators just select the third arbitrator. Each arbitrator should be properly credentialed with expert knowledge and practical experience regarding dispute. The initiating Person shall give written notice of its decision to arbitrate by providing a specific statement setting forth the nature of the dispute, the amount involved and the remedy sought. The parties shall have an equal and fair opportunity to present their respective positions to the arbitrators, orally or in writing, as the arbitrators may specify depending on the nature of the dispute. The arbitrators may require such testimony, materials and documentation as they may determine to be appropriate. The arbitrators shall provide a written resolution within thirty days after the conclusion of the presentations of the parties and receipt of requested materials and documents.

> (b) **Costs**. The arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator, all of its costs and expenses including any attorney's fees, arbitrator's fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any kind. The term "prevailing party" shall mean the party whose position is most nearly upheld in the arbitration. (For example, the prevailing party would be the party who is required to pay $1000.00 in the arbitration proceeding were such party had, prior to the commencement of the arbitration, offered $500.00 by way of settlement and the opposing party, refusing such offer, had claimed entitlement to \$10,000.00.)

> (c) **Binding Nature; Applicable Law**. The consideration of the parties to be bound by arbitration is not only the waiver of access to determinatin by a court and/or jury, but also the waiver of any rights to appeal the arbitration finding other than for the reasons set forth in Sections 8.01-581.010 and 8.01-581.011 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. A judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator maybe entered any in any court having jurisdiction.

If a dispute involves the Declarant or the Association, no Person shall file a memorandum of _lis pendens_ or similar instrument that would encumber or create a lien upon the real estate owned either by the Declarant or the Association.
